// Gameboard module
    //Create gameboard with "blank" spaces
    //Function to get a copy of the gameboard safely (getter)
    //Check if a move is valid (if cell is empty)
    //Update the cell with player's move
    //Reset gameboard
    //Check if board is full

// Game Controller / Players module
    //Create two players (could be just symbols "X" and "O" for now)
    //Handle move: player picks a cell → module checks → updates gameboard
    //Check for win/loss/tie after every move (using winning index combos)
    //Switch players automatically after a valid move
    //Keep track of who's playing (currentPlayer)
    //Track scores (wins, losses, ties) [good addition!]
    //Allow resetting game state (board + currentPlayer + scores)
